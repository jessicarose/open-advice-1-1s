# Open-Advice-1-1s

I've been running open advice calls for technologists for the past several years, to help offer support to folks working in tech or looking to get into tech. I'm open sourcing my process and tooling here, in hopes that it will prove useful for anyone hoping to offer advice outside their immediate networks. While I've developed this process to use with people seeking advice about working in technology, this could be repurposed to fit the needs of advice seekers from any discipline.

I'm excited to improve this process and welcome PRs, especially for folks using this with non-technology audiences.

# Tooling
* [Calendly](https://calendly.com/): an automatic calendar booking system, to make it easy for advice seekers to book a slot in your calendar. Free for one meeting type, $8/month for full use. 14 day free trial available without needing a credit card.

* [Zoom](https://zoom.us/): A popular web conferencing software that can be connected to Calendly, giving each advice seeker a link for your call with them

## Optional tooling

* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/): A service that will let you connect your Calendly account to Google Sheets, useful if you want to keep a record of who you have spoken to for followup.


# Setting up Calendly

Calendly is a great tool for managing signups for your open advice 1:1s with people. You'll want to have it fully set up before advertising your availability, so that you're able to share the link when requested.

You will need to create an event type you want people to book. Name this event type something that clearly communicates the purpose of the call. For example, the calendly event type for my 1:1 calls is called "30m 1:1 Advice call". Set up your event to only run on the times and dates you want to offer advice on.

As part of your Calendly event, you can set questions that you want people booking with you to fill out. I strongly recommend adding a question asking advice seekers what they want your advice on, 

Calendly tips:
* Share your link via private or semi-private modes of communication like email, DMs or PMs.
  * Anyone who has your link can sign up, so sharing it directly on social media can lead to unexpected volume of signups
* Set a buffer period between calls, so that you have time to take notes or catch up with the details of your next call
* Make sure to only set yourself as available on days you're able to make calls
